								<h2>Live your Life </h2>
								<p>The goal in Xanadu is to encourage and nurture creativity and innovation, or in other words, you are free to do what you want to do. We want this to be a place where people feel comfortable expressing themselves in whatever manner they see fit. We would like to become an outlet for blank. All are welcome.</p>

								<h2>Everyone is equal</h2>
								<p>All members of our development team share equal responsibility for the delivery of a finished project. As an open source project, our working code and any technical documents will be publicly available online for review. Additionally, our software testers and future users will have a chance to be heard. We will be closely examining our user-submitted feedback and aggressively pursuing any reported bugs.</p>
								
								<h2>Better and Better</h2>
								<p>We strive to continually improve. Contributions from both the open-source community as well as all members of the internal development team will be used for continuous improvement of Project Xanadu.</p>
								
								<h2>Do no harm </h2>
								<p>To not allow by action or inaction our fellow beings to come to harm whether by deed or voice. Ensure that all code contributions are tested and proven safe before adding them to the project</p>
								
								<h2>Nothing is Anonymous</h2>
								<p>As a forward thinking, social-justice oriented organization, we are strongly opposed to anonymous activities within our space. As such, all users are required to register using their real identities, and interactions are subject to moderation. In this respect, we strive to protect the privacy of our user's information, and to respect their freedom of speech.</p>
